# Model-Based_Software_Design
Implementation of the controller of one pedal acceleration/braking system in accordance with ISO26262 normative. 

The project is done in 4 stages:
1. Lab 01: Item definition and HARA
2. Lab 02: Simulink implementation of the controller
3. Lab 03: Functional safety concept, implementation of plausability and voter, as well as unit and integration testing
4. Lab 04: Full executable code generation for Arduino Uno, and doing test in SimulIDE environment and on arduino implementation.

## Tools
- MATLAB 2024b
- Simulink (StateFlow, toolboxes related to code generation, Arduino Support Package)
- SimulIDE
